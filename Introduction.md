## 4. Logical/Physical Database Design

Our database design is fundamental to the success of our project. Two images illustrate two different types of databases - one uploaded to the server, and one created using draw.io. Despite the visual difference, both databases serve the same purpose.

**Database Overview:**

- "Users" table sets clear roles for candidates, companies, and managers.
- Foreign keys link tables for seamless data integration.
- Specialty tables like "interview" and "interview_on_the_go" demonstrate meticulous handling of interview processes.
- The "jobs" table lists available jobs with relevant company and experience information.
- Careful design ensures easy data retrieval and consistency, reflecting a well-thought-out database.
